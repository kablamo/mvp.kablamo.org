#### Perl Mongers

Perl Mongers are Perl user groups.  There are several hundred groups around the
world and in most major cities.  Individual groups vary in what they actually
do, but generally they are groups of Perl users in a particular location who
get together periodically (in real life) to discuss Perl.  

To find your local Perl Mongers group check out

Conference - North America) and YAPCEU (Yet Another Perl Conference - European
Union).  You can find more info on [http://yapc.org/](http://yapc.org/).
