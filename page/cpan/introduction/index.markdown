This goal of this chapter is to help developers quickly decide which modules to
use.  

MetaCPAN has thousands of modules. It's hard to know which module is the
best one.  For example there are at least 7 modules for parsing JSON.  New
modules appear all the time which make the old best solution obsolete.  It can
be hard to stay up to date.

The recommendations here are a biased set of opinions based on my personal
experiences and on the advice of people on the internet.

Please let me know when I'm wrong.
[Feedback](https://github.com/kablamo/mvp.kablamo.org/issues) is welcome and
this chapter won't be successful without it.  Part of the reason I'm writing
this is so people can tell me when I'm using the wrong module.

Here are some other great places to find advice on which module to choose:

- **MSTPAN**: [mstpan](http://blog.kablamo.org/2015/09/08/mstpan/) is a great
  set of blog posts from 2015 written by
[mst](https://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/).  It is my primary source of
inspiration.

 and I have stolen liberally and shamelessly from it.  I wanted to
make that resource available in a more discoverable format that could be
maintained via github and the community.

- **Task::Kensho**: The Enlighted Perl Organization created
[Task::Kensho](https://metacpan.org/pod/Task::Kensho). It was one of the
earliest attempts at making module recommendations.  

- **Task::BeLike::DAGOLDEN**: [Dave Golden](http://www.dagolden.com/) is the author
  of a number of widely used modules.  He keeps a [list of modules he
uses](https://metacpan.org/pod/Task::BeLike::DAGOLDEN).

- [Neil Bowers](http://neilb.org) is another great Perl
  developer who has written some [great module
reviews](http://neilb.org/reviews/).

- The use of some libraries is
[discouraged](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::Freenode::DiscouragedModules).


- **rsavage** has a [list of links](https://savage.net.au/Module-reviews.html) to module reviews on various blogs.
